<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>I was a boy when I went through the wonderful adventures
herein set down. With the memory of my boyish feelings
strong upon me, I present my book specially to boys, in the
earnest hope that they may derive valuable information, much
pleasure, great profit, and unbounded amusement from its
pages.</p>

<p>One word more. If there is any boy or man who loves to
be melancholy and morose, and who cannot enter with kindly
sympathy into the regions of fun, let me seriously advise him to
shut my book and put it away. It is not meant for him.</p>
